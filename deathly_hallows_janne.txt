None of the people seated underneath this singular sight were looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so.\"Yaxley. Snape,\" said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. \"You are very nearly late.\"The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they drew nearer, however, his face shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow.\"Severus, here,\" said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate right. \"Yaxley – beside Dolohov.\"The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke first.\"So?\"\"My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.\"The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort.\"Saturday ... at nightfall,\" repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon Snape's black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into Voldemort's face and, after a moment or two, Voldemort's lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.\"Good. Very good. And this information comes – \"\" – from the source we discussed,\" said Snape.\"My Lord.\"Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. All faces turned to him.\"My Lord, I have heard differently.\"Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, \"Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.\"Snape was smiling.\"My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; he is known to be susceptible.\"\"I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,\" said Yaxley.\"If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,\" said Snape. \"I assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry.\"\"The Order's got one thing right, then, eh?\" said a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table.Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought.
